# MySearchEngine-APP
Creating a search engine using Depth-First Search (DFS) as a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project in Java can be an interesting endeavor. In this project, we'll assume that you're implementing a basic search engine for a collection of documents, where you want to perform keyword-based searches using DFS. Here's a detailed breakdown of the project:
I am using the Crawler base or connected to  the database and performing quickly. and also availabe on the history section 
there are two type or buttons availabe on My serach engine app
1-Search
2-History

1. Document Representation:
Define a Document class to represent individual documents.
Each Document object should have attributes like url, title, content, etc.
2. Data Storage:
Create a data structure (e.g., an array, ArrayList, or any other suitable structure) to store multiple Document objects.
3. Graph Representation (Optional):
Represent the collection of documents as a graph if you want to consider relationships between documents (e.g., linking related documents).
4. Tokenization:
Implement a tokenizer to break down the content of each document into individual words (tokens).
Remove punctuation and convert tokens to lowercase for consistency.
5. Indexing:
Build an index data structure to map keywords to the documents that contain them.
This can be done using a HashMap where keywords are keys and the associated values are lists of Document objects.
6. Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm:
Implement a DFS algorithm to traverse the index and retrieve documents containing a specific keyword.
Start from the keyword node in the index and traverse through the associated document nodes.
7. Search Functionality:
Implement a search function that takes a keyword as input and uses the DFS algorithm to find and return documents containing that keyword.
The search function should return a list of matching Document objects.
8. User Interface (Optional):
Create a simple user interface using the console or graphical libraries (Swing, JavaFX) to interact with the search engine.
Allow users to input keywords and display the search results.
9. Testing:
Develop test cases to ensure your search engine works correctly for various scenarios.
Test it with different keywords, documents, and graph structures.
10. Optimization (Optional):
Consider implementing optimization techniques, such as caching frequently searched keywords or using more advanced data structures for indexing (e.g., Trie).
